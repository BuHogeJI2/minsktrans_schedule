### This is react application with google map which shows public transport's stops in Minsk

##### Features:
    - grouping markers when zooming;
    - show stop's info when clicking on it; 

###### Bugs:
    - excess small InfoWindow at first click on marker (it still there, but hidden
    under needed InfoWindow);
    - don't work API_KEY from google (mode only for developers, because 
    I haven't billing account);
